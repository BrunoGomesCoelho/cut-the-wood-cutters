# Imaflora at the 2019's `V Mathematics Solutions Workshop for Industrial Problems` organized by the [Centro de Ciências Matemáticas Aplicadas a Industria](http://www.cemeai.icmc.usp.br/).


### The problem

In 2019, [Imaflora](http://www.imaflora.org/) brought to ICMC their recently acquired dataset of 11 years of [DOF's](https://www.ibama.gov.br/cadastros/dof) from over Brazil. As part of the 5-day event, mathematicians, statistician and computer science students tackled various challenges in the data, with the hope of understanding illegal deforestation.

This repository contains some of the code developed during the various days in the hope the company and other people might find the analysis useful. 

### Structure

- All code is presented as jupyter notebook files
- A subset of the data of the data representing only 2 brazilian stated can be download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dw3ZQTn0v4sQQMJEIBonhzGwP162kaDG/view?usp=sharing)
